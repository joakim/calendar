### Why base it on the Persian calendar?

It is the most accurate calendar designed. In my opinion, its astronomical and mathematical basis is also the most elegant. Basing the calendar on astronomical observations is not only scientifically sound, but on some level even poetic. Omar Khayyâm was after all both an astronomer and a poet.

The year being reborn in spring is an idea that resonates deeply with people. Many cultures celebrate the coming of spring around northward equinox (for example [Nowruz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nowruz), [Hıdırellez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C4%B1d%C4%B1rellez) and [Falles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falles)), often involving bonfires or burning of effigies, often symbolizing rebirth or fertility. At least in the northern hemisphere, where approximately 90% of us live.

### Why 8 "months" and 9-day "weeks"?

To answer this, one should first answer the question "Why 12 months and 7-day weeks?", the common division of the year in many calendars. The first calendars were lunar calendars, tracking the easily observed phases of the Moon. A full lunar cycle is just under 30 days (29.53 days on average). Over time, our attention turned to the stars and the sun, as our understanding of astronomy grew. Eventually, agriculture and trade brought the need for a calendar that better followed the seasons. The Egyptian solar calendar was the first to abandon the lunar cycle and instead focus on Earth's cycle around the Sun. Still, it divided the solar year into 12 months of 30 days – maybe to ease the transition from the lunar calendar? The 7-day week is harder to explain. We know the number 7 held a special significance to the Babylonians and Sumerians. Maybe it represented the 7 visible celestial bodies, including the Sun and the Moon?

Being a purely solar calendar, this calendar does not attempt to unify the Moon's cycle around Earth with Earth's cycle around the Sun. Nor does it try to unify the 7-day week with the calendar year. By not being tied to such constraints, one is free to devise new divisions of the year, leading to [advantages](https://www.hermetic.ch/cal_stud/ltc/ltc.htm#advantages) not found in traditional calendars.

8 "months" is the logical outcome of first reducing the year to 360 common days, dividing it by 2, then dividing each half by 2, then each quarter by 2. This results in a number of days divisible by 9 to achieve "weeks" of 3 * 3 days, a very flexible and powerful construct. While one could stop at 4 quarters of 90 common days, practicality demands smaller divisions of the year. 8 ("months" of the year) and 9 (days of the "week") are small enough numbers to be easily memorized.

12 "months" of exactly 30 days is possible in this calendar. However, one would lose the advantages gained by dividing the "month" into "weeks" of 3 * 3 days. One would also need 12 new names to avoid confusion with the traditional 12 months.

To summarize: The advantages gained by dividing the year into 8 "months" and 9-day "weeks" outweigh the disadvantage of being unfamiliar. A new calendar should not be constrained by the requirements of the old, but reflect the requirements of today's dynamic global society.
