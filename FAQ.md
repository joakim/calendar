# Questions and Answers

### Why base it on the Persian calendar?

It is the most accurate calendar designed. I'd also argue that its astronomical and mathematical basis is the most elegant. Basing the calendar on astronomical observations is not only scientifically sound, but on some level even poetic. [Omar Khayyâm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayyam) was after all both an astronomer and a poet.

The year being reborn in spring is an idea that resonates deeply with people. Many cultures celebrate the coming of spring around northward equinox (for example [Nowruz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nowruz), [Hıdırellez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C4%B1d%C4%B1rellez) and [Falles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falles)), often involving bonfires or burning of effigies, often symbolizing rebirth or fertility. (At least in the northern hemisphere, where approximately 90% of us live.)

### Is the calendar religious or secular?

Neither. Or both. It is absolutely neutral to this question. It is possible to ignore the proposed 9-day "week" and Holocene Era epoch, and retain the traditional 7-day week and Anno Domini. Being tied to the northward equinox, the calendar can be both scientifically precise and religiously relevant.

### Why 8 "months" and 9-day "weeks"?

To answer this, one should first answer the question "Why 12 months and 7-day weeks?", the common division of the year in many calendars. The first calendars were lunar calendars, tracking the easily observed phases of the Moon. A full lunar cycle is just under 30 days (29.53 days on average). Over time, our attention turned to the stars and the sun, as our understanding of astronomy grew. Eventually, agriculture and trade brought the need for a calendar that better followed the seasons. The Egyptian solar calendar was the first to abandon the lunar cycle and instead focus on Earth's cycle around the Sun. Still, it divided the solar year into 12 months of 30 days – maybe to ease the transition from the lunar calendar? The 7-day week is harder to explain. We know the number 7 held a special significance to the Babylonians and Sumerians. Maybe it represented the 5 visible celestial bodies plus the Sun and the Moon?

Being a purely solar calendar, this calendar does not attempt to unify the Moon's cycle around Earth with Earth's cycle around the Sun. Nor does it try to unify the 7-day week with the calendar year. By not being tied to such constraints, one can achieve advantages not possible in traditional calendars.

8 "months" was chosen because its 45 days is cleanly divisible by 9 to achieve "weeks" of 3 * 3 days, a very flexible and powerful construct. While one could achieve the same with 4 quarters of 90 common days, practicality demands smaller "months". 8 "months" of the year and 9 "weekdays" are also small enough sets to be easily memorized, an important consideration.

To summarize: The advantages gained by dividing the year into 8 "months" and 40 "weeks" outweigh the disadvantage of being unfamiliar. A new calendar should not be constrained by the requirements of the old, but reflect the requirements of today's dynamic global society.

### Why not 12 months? Or 10, 13, etc?

12 months of exactly 30 common days _is_ possible in this calendar. However, one would lose the advantages gained by dividing the month into "weeks" of 3 * 3 days. One would also need 12 new names to avoid confusion with the traditional 12 months.

10 "months" of 36 common days isn't cleanly divisible by 4, a quarter would not have a whole number of "months". Other divisions of 360 are either incompatible with 4 quarters and 9-day "weeks" (important features of this calendar) or produce too large or too small "months".
