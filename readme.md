# A Calendar for Time to Come

A [perennial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perennial_calendar) [solar calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_calendar) based on astronomical observations.

The [calendar year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar_year) consists of 360 calendar days + 5 [intercalary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercalation_(timekeeping)#Solar_calendars) days, divided into 4 equal quarters of 1 intercalary day + 90 calendar days. The remaining days of the year are intercalary transition days between years.

The 360 calendar days may be divided into 8 months of 45 days, as well as 40 weeks of 9 days (3 x 3, based on [tridays](https://www.hermetic.ch/cal_stud/ltc/ltc.htm)). Alternatively, one can use the more traditional 12 months of 30 days and a 7-day week. A zero-indexed variant based on the 9-day week is also possible. See [Variants](https://calendars.wikia.org/wiki/A_Calendar_for_Time_to_Come#Variants) for more.

The calendar year begins at the midnight closest to the instant of the [northward equinox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northward_equinox) as measured from the [prime meridian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_meridian). Consequently, if the northward equinox falls before [solar noon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noon#Solar_noon) on a particular day, then that day is the first day of the year. If the northward equinox occurs after solar noon, the following day begins the calendar year.

The calendar's proposed [epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoch) is the beginning of the [human era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_calendar) (10001 BC).

Essentially, it's the [Persian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_calendars) with a different epoch, a different meridian and a different division of the year. The calendar and its astronomical basis is deeply indebted to Persian astronomer [Omar Khayyam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayyam)'s 11th century reform of the [Jalali calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalali_calendar).

### Advantages

- **[Accurate](#accuracy)** — follows the true solar year
- **Balanced** – division of the year into equal parts
- **Dynamic** — grouping of days into 3 × 3 is a [powerful concept](https://www.hermetic.ch/cal_stud/ltc/ltc.htm#advantages)
- **Predictable** — has a consistent, perennial structure
- **Simple** — easy to learn and uncomplicated to use

It is structured, yet flexible enough to adapt to different uses and cultures:
  - **Agriculture** — follows natural cycles
  - **Business** — divided into equal parts, allows for flexible schedules
  - **Civil** — simple and predictable

The calendar is not tied to any culture/religion, except inevitably to that of the current scientific paradigm. While it is scientifically grounded, it does not oppose combination with cultural or religious concepts.

### Disadvantages

- **Unfamiliarity** — new divisions, units and beginning of year
- **No simple leap year rule** — a tradeoff for astronomical accuracy over time
- **Yet another calendar** — made by some commoner named Joakim (who is not the pope)

### Accuracy

Observation-based calendars embrace the non-uniform motion of the Earth around the Sun, as well as the short-term perturbations. The future can never be predicted with absolute certainty, due to the dynamic nature of the universe. The only way to know with absolute certainty the length of the year is through observation.

Calendars based on the Jalali calendar are the most accurate in relation to the true solar year. Today's astronomical knowledge and computing power enable us to predict with very high precision the instant of the northward equinox. The exact instant can now be measured to an accuracy of better than 1 millisecond ([Heydari-Malayeri, 2004](http://aramis.obspm.fr/~heydari/divers/ir-cal-eng.html)).

### What it is not

#### This calendar does not attempt to:

- Reform an existing calendar
- Follow the traditional 7-day week
- Incorporate the [lunar phases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_phase), as [lunisolar calendars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunisolar_calendar) are inherently complex and irregular
- Accurately follow the [astronomical seasons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season#Astronomical), as their lengths change over time
- Align with the [zodiac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zodiac), due to the (lunisolar) [precession of the ecliptic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_precession)

However, features like these may be applied, just as they are applied to existing calendars. For example, the unbroken chain of 7-day weeks may be used just like in the Gregorian calendar, with weekdays retaining their traditional names and cultural/religious significance, if so is desired.
